=over 4

=item DBI
This module is used to connect to the database that Tinderbox uses 
to store its information.

=item Data::Dumper
The Data::Dumper module provides data structure persistence for Perl
(similar to Java's serialization).  It comes with later sub-releases of
Perl 5.004, but a re-installation just to be sure it's available won't
hurt anything. Data::Dumper is used by the MySQL related Perl modules.

=item DBD::mysql
This module is used to connect to the mysql database that Tinderbox uses 
to store its information.

=item Bundle::Libnet
Makes the magic work

=item Mail::Tools
For sending mail (what else?)

=item Time::Date
Handles the time for Tinderbox
